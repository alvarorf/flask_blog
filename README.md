### Flask blog

Welcome to my flask blog project.
This is sample website that uses Python 3/Flask as the backend and some Html/CSS(Bootstrap 4) as the front end. 
Users can create/update and delete posts. They can also create an account, upload their profile picture (which ) log in and log out.
The website is deployed to a Linux server using Nginx.
